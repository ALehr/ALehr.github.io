and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe</a><br>
<span class="rating">★★★★★</span><br> Easily one of my favorite books,
along with the sequel. This was my third time reading it, and it holds
up. I'm excited to discuss this one with my students at the start of
term.</p></li>
<li><p><a

Perks of Being a Wallflower</a><br>
<span class="rating">★★★★★</span><br> I haven't read this book since I
was in high school, and I forgot how heavy it is. It doesn't shy away
from the pain of being a lonely adolescent, and it talks frankly about
all the activities that parents often don't want to think about their
kids partaking in. It's a very honest, kind, and empathetic book, and I
think it holds up.</p></li>

the Great Is Not Okay</a><br> <span class="rating">★★★★☆</span><br> It's
cute and it reads fast since it's YA. I loved the discussion of mental
illness, especially among male characters. I also learned a lot about
Iran and Persian culture.</p></li>

Brother's Husband</a><br> <span class="rating">★★★★☆</span><br> I wasn't
expecting to like this manga as much as I did, but I really enjoyed it.
It's very cutesy and wholesome, even though it deals with some heavy
themes.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/VS2gv--0Pug?si=SpVxwTOfs3k7NrZv">The
Boyfriend</a><br> <span class="rating">★★★☆☆</span><br> Very cute and
wholesome, just as all the reviews I've read promised. I don't usually
watch reality TV, but I wanted to watch this one a) to support queer
media, and b) everyone was saying how sweet it was. I don't know that I
would recommend it, but I will probably watch a second season if they
ever release one in the US.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://youtu.be/bKGxHflevuk?si=WgTsl_5-Oe1qhzQB">Sinners</a><br>
<span class="rating">★★★★☆</span><br> Visually stunning, phenomenal
music. The plot was on the predictable side, but it was still a very fun
movie.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/PuiWDn976Ek?si=_xZkR58sLQuEc8IA">Beau
Is Afraid</a><br> <span class="rating">★★★☆☆</span><br> I'm glad I
watched it, but I was honestly disappointed. I like Ari Aster's other
films so much that I guess I had pretty high expectations for this one.
It wasn't very scary, and TBH I was pretty confused about what was going
on most of the time.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/3_jTVuExbAo?si=V43vqUWkeJzI7Yx4">What
We Do in the Shadows</a><br> <span class="rating">★★★★★</span><br>
Honestly one of the best TV commedies I've ever seen. So consistently
good, and the series finale was very satisfying.</p></li>
