<ul>
<li><p>Darius the Great Is Not Okay<br>
<span class="rating">★★★★☆</span><br> It's cute and it reads fast since
it's YA. I loved the discussion of mental illness, especially among male
characters. I also learned a lot about Iran and Persian
culture.</p></li>
<li><p>My Brother's Husband<br> <span class="rating">★★★★☆</span><br> I
wasn't expecting to like this manga as much as I did, but I really
enjoyed it. It's very cutesy and wholesome, even though it deals with
some heavy themes.</p></li>

<li><p>Sinners<br> <span class="rating">★★★★☆</span><br> Visually

was still a very fun movie.</p></li>
<li><p>Beau Is Afraid<br> <span class="rating">★★★☆☆</span><br> I'm glad
I watched it, but I was honestly disappointed. I like Ari Aster's other
films so much, that I guess I had pretty high expectations for this one.
It wasn't very scary, and TBH I was pretty confused about what was going
on most of the time.</p></li>
<li><p>What We Do in the Shadows<br>
<span class="rating">★★★★★</span><br> Honestly one of the best TV
commedies I've ever seen. So consistently good, and the series finale
was very satisfying.</p></li>

<h3>Saturday 2 August 2025</h3>
<p>Instead of writing a bunch of little blog posts throughout my time in
Salt Lake City, I figured I could just write a summary post once I got
back to Maryland. So that’s what this is.</p>
<p>Highlights from the trip:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>revisited two of my favorite restaurants in the city: <a
href="https://www.evasbakeryslc.com">Eva’s Bakery</a> and <a
href="https://ruthsdiner.com">Ruth’s Diner</a></p></li>
<li><p>found some cool old Italian western comics from the 70s and 80s
in <a
href="https://www.visitsaltlake.com/listing/utah-book-%26-magazine/63825/">Utah
Book &amp; Magazine</a></p></li>
<li><p>watching the Pioneer Day fireworks with my niece and younger
nephew</p></li>
<li><p>playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_10">Phase
10</a> before bed most nights</p></li>
<li><p>taking my niece on her first train ride around the city</p></li>
<li><p>getting a bunch of Pokémon collectibles with my sister and my
older nephew</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Wednesday 16 July 2025</h3>
<p>Daniel and I made it safely to Salt Lake City, but man oh man has it
been a rough day. We both got very little sleep last night.</p>
<p>Our flight this morning boarded at 7:30, and it takes an hour and 40
minutes to get to the airport from our house. Rather than getting up
super early to get to the airport on time, we decided to spend last
night at a hotel near the airport. That way we could get up a bit later
in the morning and get better sleep. (We wouldn't normally spend money
on something like this, but given that we won't be paying for a hotel
stay in SLC, we felt that the expense was worth it.)</p>
<p>What we failed to take into account was the time it would take to get
to the hotel. We decided to take the metro to the airport and then to
take the hotel’s free shuttle from the airport to the hotel. This added
an extra 30 minutes onto the trip, and then we missed two shuttles (one
because we couldn’t find it and the second because it was full). That
added another hour onto the trip. We ended up getting to bed around 11
and getting less sleep than we would have if we had just stayed home and
gotten up early.</p>
<p>The moral of the story: Think through full timelines before you make
last-minute changes to your travel plans. 😓</p>

<p>I've been playing Pokémon Unite again recently and just picked up
this holowear for Wigglytuff during a special event:</p>

<p>It's silly, but it made my day.</p>
