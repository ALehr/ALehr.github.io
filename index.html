Also important, I think. It's about death and what brings us there. The first half is about old age and the history of elder care, including intergenerational homes, poor houses, nursing homes, and assisted living facilities. The second half is about terminal cancer patients.</p> <p>The main message of the book is that we're all going to die, but no one wants to think about the realities of death, so we tend to make poor decisions about our health care at the end of our lives. Instead, Gawande urges everyone to think about what they really want in the end and to make medical decisions based on those priorities. He also offers guidance on how to have those conversations, both with others and with ourselves.</p> <h4 id="finish-what-we-started-the-maga-governments-ground-war-to-end-democracy"><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/finish-what-we-started-the-maga-movement-s-ground-war-to-end-democracy-isaac-arnsdorf/b8883ac56adfcff0?ean=9780316497718&amp;next=t">Finish What We Started: The MAGA Government's Ground War to End Democracy</a></h4> <p><span class="rating">★★★★☆</span></p> <p>Oof. Dark and upsetting. This book details the strategy that MAGA Republicans followed to destabilize and take over the Republican party. It also shows how a lot of Republicans got radicalized to begin with.</p> <p>Each chapter is told as a character-driven narrative, which really helped me to understand how, within the conservative echo chamber, otherwise rational individuals came to believe / go along with some really crazy stuff. (And it also pulls no punches when it comes to discussing the reality of all the angry, bad-faith bad actors in the party.)</p> <p><a href="/reviews#Books"><strong>read more</strong></a></p> </section><section id="updates"> <h2 id="truck-life-updates">🚚 Life Updates</h2> <ul> <li><p>August 2024: Started teaching high school Latin</p></li> <li><p>July 2024: Moved to Maryland</p></li> <li><p>May 2024: Finished my MA at UMass</p></li> <li><p>August 2022: Moved to Massachusetts</p></li> <li><p>April 2022: Got married!

It's fun, and it's touching. It's also packed full of great D&amp;D references that you'll appreciate if you play, but they aren't essential to know what's going on or to enjoy the show.<br><br> I can't wait for season 2 to come out, and I'll probably read the manga in the meantime.</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/OpThntO9ixc?si=sAadp9qtwOyOl_eF">Weapons</a><br> <span class="rating">★★★★★</span><br> Holy shit! Such a good horror film! It's very well structured and maintains suspense throughout the runtime. The acting was great, the story was engaging, the minimal visuals were employed very well.
