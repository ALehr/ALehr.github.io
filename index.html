Perks of Being a Wallflower</a><br>
<span class="rating">★★★★★</span><br> I haven't read this book since I
was in high school, and I forgot how heavy it is. It doesn't shy away
from the pain of being a lonely adolescent, and it talks frankly about
all the activities that parents often don't want to think about their
kids partaking in. It's a very honest, kind, and empathetic book, and I
think it holds up.</p></li>

wholesome, just as all the reviews I've read promised. I don't usually
watch reality TV, but I wanted to watch this one a) to support queer
media, and b) everyone was saying how sweet it was. I don't know that I
would recommend it, but I will probably watch a second season if they
ever release one in the US.</p></li>

It wasn't very scary, and TBH I was pretty confused about what was going

good, and the series finale was very satisfying.</p></li>

<h3>Saturday 2 August 2025</h3>
<p>Instead of writing a bunch of little blog posts throughout my time in
Salt Lake City, I figured I could just write a summary post once I got
back to Maryland. So that’s what this is.</p>
<p>Highlights from the trip:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>revisited two of my favorite restaurants in the city: <a
href="https://www.evasbakeryslc.com">Eva’s Bakery</a> and <a
href="https://ruthsdiner.com">Ruth’s Diner</a></p></li>
<li><p>found some cool old Italian western comics from the 70s and 80s
in <a
href="https://www.visitsaltlake.com/listing/utah-book-%26-magazine/63825/">Utah
Book &amp; Magazine</a></p></li>
<li><p>watching the Pioneer Day fireworks with my niece and younger
nephew</p></li>
<li><p>playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_10">Phase
10</a> before bed most nights</p></li>
<li><p>taking my niece on her first train ride around the city</p></li>
<li><p>getting a bunch of silly Pokémon collectibles with my sister and
my older nephew at <a href="https://nerdstoreutah.com">The Nerd
Store</a></p></li>

<h3>Wednesday 16 July 2025</h3>
<p>Daniel and I are in Salt Lake City visiting some family. We made it
here safely, but man oh man has it been a rough day. We both got very
little sleep last night.</p>
<p>Our flight this morning boarded at 7:30, and it takes an hour and 40
minutes to get to the airport from our house. Rather than getting up
super early to get to the airport on time, we decided to spend last
night at a hotel near the airport. That way we could get up a bit later
in the morning and get better sleep. (We wouldn't normally spend money
on something like this, but given that we won't be paying for a hotel
stay in SLC, we felt that the expense was worth it.)</p>
<p>What we failed to take into account was the time it would take to get
to the hotel. We decided to take the metro to the airport and then to
take the hotel’s free shuttle from the airport to the hotel. This added
an extra 30 minutes onto the trip, and then we missed two shuttles (one
because we couldn’t find it and the second because it was full). That
added another hour onto the trip. We ended up getting to bed around 11
and getting less sleep than we would have if we had just stayed home and
gotten up early.</p>
<p>The moral of the story: Think through full timelines before you make
last-minute changes to your travel plans. 😓</p>

<article id="2025-07-12">
<h3>Saturday 12 July 2025</h3>
<p>So I decided to build a blog. In the year of our Lord 2025, I decided
to build an old-school blog.</p>
<h4 id="but-like-why-a-blog">But like, why a blog?</h4>
<p>Lots of reasons.</p>
<p>Last year, a friend of mine started sending quarterly updates on her
life to friends and family via a snail-mail quarterly periodical that
she designs and prints herself. I love this idea so much and wanted to
do something similar, but I prefer to do things digitally. While
brainstorming options, I realized that what I really want is just some
simple, straightforward way to keep the people in my life up to date on
what’s going on with me, my interests, what I’m up to, etc.</p>
<p>I briefly flirted with the idea of trying to be more intentional
about my use of Instagram to achieve this goal, but:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Instagram is simply way too distracting for me (and you too, I
bet).</p></li>
<li><p>Instagram posts and stories are image-first, which means
that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I would need to find an image to headline every update I may want
to share, even if I don’t need or want an image. (I.e., you can’t just
write a plain-text blog post.)</p></li>
<li><p>The image becomes the focus of any given update, and people may
not even read the caption (which would contain the update I’m trying to
share in the first place).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You can’t customize your Instagram profile much, and I want more
room for self-expression (changing colors and fonts, layouts, widgets,
etc).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I realized that what I really want is something like old-school
MySpace. I want a webpage that’s exclusively about me, with no banners
and sidebars all over the place that link to other people’s stuff. I
want a webpage that I can customize to include whatever I want in
whatever configuration I want. I want the nostalgic experience of
something retro (like my friend’s periodical).</p>
<h4 id="why-did-i-build-it-all-myself">Why did I build it all
myself?</h4>
<p>I browsed around a bit to see whether there were any websites out
there that met my criteria, but nothing really felt right to me. So I
decided that if I want <em>exactly what I want</em>, I should make it
myself.</p>
<p>Notice that at the top of this post I said that I decided to “build”
a blog, not “start” a blog. This website that you’re reading this on, I
built it all myself. And it’s not just plain HTML and CSS either — I
built an entire static site generator that creates the HTML I need from
individual text files that hold my blog posts and interests
sections.</p>
<p>So like, why did I do this?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because I can.</li>
<li>Because I haven’t done much web development since I left my job at
the software company, and I miss it.</li>
<li>Because I wanted full control over the structure of the components
of the website.</li>
<li>Because I wanted to challenge myself with a difficult project over
the summer.</li>
<li>Because I wanted to learn some new skills (which I did!)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h4>
<p>I’ll be posting whatever I feel like to this website for the
foreseeable future. I may advertise updates on Instagram, or I may not.
Ultimately, even if no one really reads this blog, I’m going to keep it
up because I’m having a lot of fun with it.</p>
<p>Eventually I'd also like to turn this little project into something
that anyone can use to customize and publish their own blog. More to
come on that as I get things worked out.</p>
