I've enjoyed it a lot, don't get me wrong, but I got tired of it much more quickly than I had expected. I LOVED the first game, and I really enjoyed this sequel, but I just didn't connect with it in the same way. The gameplay is a good iteration on the original, and the story is interesting, but it's just missing something for me. I kept playing the Hades endgame content for a <em>long</em> time after having finished the main story, but I struggled to even stick with Hades 2 for long enough to finish off the two final bosses.</p> <p>I realize that this review doesn't really reflect the rating I gave the game, but that's just because I'm comparing it to the first game. Hades 2 is a very good game, it just doesn't fully reach the bar set by the first game. I still recommend it, though.</p> <p><a href="/reviews#Video%20Games"><strong>read more</strong></a></p> </section><section id="reading" class="card"> <h2 id="books-what-im-reading">📚 What I'm Reading</h2> <h3 id="currently-reading">Currently Reading</h3> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-god-of-the-woods-a-novel-liz-moore/c3cbf4f80cbe4a47?ean=9780593418925&amp;next=t">The God of the Woods by Liz Moore</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/alguien-para-ti-someone-for-you-juan-arcones/d44c8720802fb395?ean=9786073836395&amp;next=t">Alguien para Ti by Juan Arcones</a></p></li> </ul> <h3 id="past-reads">Past Reads</h3> <h4 id="the-secret-history-by-donna-tartt-reread"><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-secret-history-donna-tartt/de5042f1caf6ae3a?ean=9781400031702&amp;next=t">The Secret History by Donna Tartt</a> (reread)</h4> <p><span class="rating">★★★★★</span></p> <p>I read The Secret History a few years ago, and I remember liking it a lot. Recently, however, I've had some conversations about the book with other Classicists, who are generally pretty divided on it. So I decided to revisit it to see whether my opinion on the book has changed now that I've been teaching Latin and Classical Humanities for four years. Nope — I still really like this book. I find it compelling and well written, and I sped through it just as quickly as the first time I read it.</p> <p>This second time around, I listened to the audio book, which is narrated by the author. I enjoyed it a lot, which was a surprise since authors are not always the best readers of their own books. There were a few things I didn't like — her pronunciation of Latin, Greek, and French is atrocious, and I found the voice that she puts on for Bunny to be a bit grating — but overall I enjoyed listening to her.</p> <p><a href="/reviews#Books"><strong>read more</strong></a></p> </section><section id="updates" class="card"> <h2 id="truck-life-updates">🚚 Life Updates</h2> <ul> <li><p>August 2024: Started teaching high school Latin</p></li> <li><p>July 2024: Moved to Maryland</p></li> <li><p>May 2024: Finished my MA at UMass</p></li> <li><p>August 2022: Moved to Massachusetts</p></li> <li><p>April 2022: Got married!

I binged all three seasons plus the two movies in a matter of weeks. I can't recommend it enough.</p> <p>Note that the show is in Spanish. If you don't speak Spanish, I still recommend it, and I recommend that you watch it in Spanish with subtitles. The actors are so good, their delivery is so on point, and I would worry that something would be lost in the English dub.</p> <p><a href="/reviews#Films"><strong>read more</strong></a></p> </section><!-- END converted .md from /markdown/homepage/ -->
