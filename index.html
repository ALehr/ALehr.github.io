This was my third time reading it, and it was just as moving as the first time I read it.<br><br> As the title implies, this second volume is about Aristotle and Dante figuring out where they fit in the broader world of adults and just how difficult that can be. The book explores racism, classism, and homophobia in a frank but age-appropriate manner. An essential read, in my opinion.<br><br> The only thing I don't love about this book is how overly earnest all the characters are. It feels a bit artificial and cringy to me, even for a YA book. That said, it's not a major distraction and does not detract from all the things I love about this book.</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-magic-fish-trung-le-nguyen/14722854?ean=9781984851598&amp;next=t">The Magic Fish</a><br> <span class="rating">★★★★★</span><br> Such a sweet comic.

It's fun, and it's touching. It's also packed full of great D&amp;D references that you'll appreciate if you play, but they aren't essential to know what's going on or to enjoy the show.<br><br> I can't wait for season 2 to come out, and I'll probably read the manga in the meantime.</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/OpThntO9ixc?si=sAadp9qtwOyOl_eF">Weapons</a><br> <span class="rating">★★★★★</span><br> Holy shit! Such a good horror film! It's very well structured and maintains suspense throughout the runtime. The acting was great, the story was engaging, the minimal visuals were employed very well.
