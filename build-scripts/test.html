This was my third time reading it, and it holds up. I'm excited to discuss this one with my students at the start of term.\<\/p\>\<\/article\>\<article id="darius-the-great-is-not-okay"\>\<h3\>\<a href="https:\/\/bookshop.org\/p\/books\/darius-the-great-is-not-okay-adib-khorram\/16449090?ean=9780525552970\&next=t"\>Darius the Great Is Not Okay\<\/a\>\<\/h3\> \<p class="rating"\>★★★★☆\<\/p\> \<p\>It's cute and it reads fast since it's YA. I loved the discussion of mental illness, especially among male characters. I also learned a lot about Iran and Persian culture.\<\/p\>\<\/article\>\<article id="my-brothers-husband"\>\<h3\>\<a href="https:\/\/bookshop.org\/p\/books\/my-brother-s-husband-volumes-1-2-gengoroh-tagame\/8520603?ean=9780375715181\&next=t"\>My Brother's Husband\<\/a\>\<\/h3\> \<p class="rating"\>★★★★☆\<\/p\> \<p\>I wasn't expecting to like this manga as much as I did, but I really enjoyed it. It's very cutesy and wholesome, even though it deals with some heavy themes.\<\/p\>\<\/article\>\<article id="perks-of-being-a-wallflower"\>\<h3\>\<a href="https:\/\/bookshop.org\/p\/books\/the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower-stephen-chbosky\/7061668?ean=9780671027346\&next=t"\>The Perks of Being a Wallflower\<\/a\>\<\/h3\> \<p class="rating"\>★★★★★\<\/p\> \<p\>I haven't read this book since I was in high school, and I forgot how heavy it is. It doesn't shy away from the pain of being a lonely adolescent, and it talks frankly about all the activities that parents often don't want to think about their kids partaking in. It's a very honest, kind, and empathetic book, and I think it holds up.\<\/p\>\<\/article\>\<\/section\>\<section id="comics-and-graphic-novels"\>\<h2\>comics-and-graphic-novels\<\/h2\>\<article id="magic-fish"\>\<h3\>\<a href="https:\/\/bookshop.org\/p\/books\/the-magic-fish-trung-le-nguyen\/14722854?ean=9781984851598\&next=t"\>The Magic Fish\<\/a\>\<\/h3\> \<p class="rating"\>★★★★★\<\/p\> \<p\>Such a sweet comic. A beautiful little story about family, immigration, culture, language, and queerness. This one checks all my boxes.\<\/p\>\<\/article\>\<\/section\>\<section id="films"\>\<h2\>films\<\/h2\>\<article id="beau-is-afraid"\>\<h3\>\<a href="https:\/\/youtu.be\/PuiWDn976Ek?si=_xZkR58sLQuEc8IA"\>Beau Is Afraid\<\/a\>\<\/h3\> \<p class="rating"\>★★★☆☆\<\/p\> \<p\>I'm glad I watched it, but I was honestly disappointed. I like Ari Aster's other films so much that I guess I had pretty high expectations for this one. It wasn't very scary, and TBH I was pretty confused about what was going on most of the time.\<\/p\>\<\/article\>\<article id="sinners"\>\<h3\>\<a href="https:\/\/youtu.be\/bKGxHflevuk?si=WgTsl_5-Oe1qhzQB"\>Sinners\<\/a\>\<\/h3\> \<p class="rating"\>★★★★☆\<\/p\> \<p\>Visually stunning, phenomenal music. The plot was on the predictable side, but it was still a very fun movie.\<\/p\>\<\/article\>\<\/section\>\<section id="series"\>\<h2\>series\<\/h2\>\<article id="boyfriend"\>\<h3\>\<a href="https:\/\/youtu.be\/VS2gv--0Pug?si=SpVxwTOfs3k7NrZv"\>The Boyfriend\<\/a\>\<\/h3\> \<p class="rating"\>★★★☆☆\<\/p\> \<p\>Very cute and wholesome, just as all the reviews I've read promised. I don't usually watch reality TV, but I wanted to watch this one a) to support queer media, and b) everyone was saying how sweet it was. I don't know that I would recommend it, but I will probably watch a second season if they ever release one in the US.\<\/p\>\<\/article\>\<article id="what-we-do-in-the-shadows"\>\<h3\>\<a href=""\>What We Do in the Shadows\<\/a\>\<\/h3\> \<p class="rating"\>★★★★★\<\/p\> \<p\>Honestly one of the best TV commedies I've ever seen. So consistently good, and the series finale was very satisfying.\<\/p\>\<\/article\>\<\/section\>\<!-- END converted .md from \/reviews\/ --\>
