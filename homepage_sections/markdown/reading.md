Such a sweet comic. A beautiful little story about family, immigration, culture, language, and queerness. This one checks all my boxes.

- [Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe](https://bookshop.org/p/books/aristotle-and-dante-discover-the-secrets-of-the-universe-benjamin-alire-saenz/7553153?ean=9781442408937&next=t)<br>

Easily one of my favorite books, along with the sequel. This was my third time reading it, and it holds up. I'm excited to discuss this one with my students at the start of term.

- [The Perks of Being a Wallflower](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower-stephen-chbosky/7061668?ean=9780671027346&next=t)<br>

I haven't read this book since I was in high school, and I forgot how heavy it is. It doesn't shy away from the pain of being a lonely adolescent, and it talks frankly about all the activities that parents often don't want to think about their kids partaking in. It's a very honest, kind, and empathetic book, and I think it holds up.

- [Darius the Great Is Not Okay](https://bookshop.org/p/books/darius-the-great-is-not-okay-adib-khorram/16449090?ean=9780525552970&next=t)<br>

It's cute and it reads fast since it's YA. I loved the discussion of mental illness, especially among male characters. I also learned a lot about Iran and Persian culture.

- [My Brother's Husband](https://bookshop.org/p/books/my-brother-s-husband-volumes-1-2-gengoroh-tagame/8520603?ean=9780375715181&next=t)<br>

I wasn't expecting to like this manga as much as I did, but I really enjoyed it. It's very cutesy and wholesome, even though it deals with some heavy themes.
