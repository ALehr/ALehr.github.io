It's cute and it reads fast since it's YA. I loved the discussion of mental illness, especially among male characters. I also learned a lot about Iran and Persian culture.

- My Brother's Husband<br>

I wasn't expecting to like this manga as much as I did, but I really enjoyed it. It's very cutesy and wholesome, even though it deals with some heavy themes.
