Visually stunning, phenomenal music. The plot was on the predictable side, but it was still a very fun movie.

- Beau Is Afraid<br>

I'm glad I watched it, but I was honestly disappointed. I like Ari Aster's other films so much, that I guess I had pretty high expectations for this one. It wasn't very scary, and TBH I was pretty confused about what was going on most of the time.

- What We Do in the Shadows<br>

Honestly one of the best TV commedies I've ever seen. So consistently good, and the series finale was very satisfying.
