### Past Series & Films

- [The Boyfriend](https://youtu.be/VS2gv--0Pug?si=SpVxwTOfs3k7NrZv)<br>
<span class="rating">★★★☆☆</span><br>
Very cute and wholesome, just as all the reviews I've read promised. I don't usually watch reality TV, but I wanted to watch this one a) to support queer media, and b) everyone was saying how sweet it was. I don't know that I would recommend it, but I will probably watch a second season if they ever release one in the US.

Visually stunning, phenomenal music. The plot was on the predictable side, but it was still a very fun movie.

- [Beau Is Afraid](https://youtu.be/PuiWDn976Ek?si=_xZkR58sLQuEc8IA)<br>

I'm glad I watched it, but I was honestly disappointed. I like Ari Aster's other films so much, that I guess I had pretty high expectations for this one. It wasn't very scary, and TBH I was pretty confused about what was going on most of the time.

- [What We Do in the Shadows](https://youtu.be/3_jTVuExbAo?si=V43vqUWkeJzI7Yx4)<br>
<span class="rating">★★★★★</span><br>
Honestly one of the best TV commedies I've ever seen. So consistently good, and the series finale was very satisfying.
