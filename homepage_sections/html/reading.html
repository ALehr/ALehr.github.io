Magic Fish</a><br> <span class="rating">â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…</span><br> Such a sweet
comic. A beautiful little story about family, immigration, culture,
language, and queerness. This one checks all my boxes.</p></li>

and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe</a><br>
<span class="rating">â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…</span><br> Easily one of my favorite books,
along with the sequel. This was my third time reading it, and it holds
up. I'm excited to discuss this one with my students at the start of
term.</p></li>
