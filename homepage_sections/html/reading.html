Perks of Being a Wallflower</a><br>
<span class="rating">â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…</span><br> I haven't read this book since I
was in high school, and I forgot how heavy it is. It doesn't shy away
from the pain of being a lonely adolescent, and it talks frankly about
all the activities that parents often don't want to think about their
kids partaking in. It's a very honest, kind, and empathetic book, and I
think it holds up.</p></li>

the Great Is Not Okay</a><br> <span class="rating">â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†</span><br> It's
cute and it reads fast since it's YA. I loved the discussion of mental
illness, especially among male characters. I also learned a lot about
Iran and Persian culture.</p></li>

Brother's Husband</a><br> <span class="rating">â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†</span><br> I wasn't
expecting to like this manga as much as I did, but I really enjoyed it.
It's very cutesy and wholesome, even though it deals with some heavy
themes.</p></li>
