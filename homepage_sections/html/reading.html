<li><p>Darius the Great Is Not Okay<br>
<span class="rating">â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†</span><br> It's cute and it reads fast since
it's YA. I loved the discussion of mental illness, especially among male
characters. I also learned a lot about Iran and Persian
culture.</p></li>
<li><p>My Brother's Husband<br> <span class="rating">â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†</span><br> I
wasn't expecting to like this manga as much as I did, but I really
enjoyed it. It's very cutesy and wholesome, even though it deals with
some heavy themes.</p></li>
