Magic Fish</a><br> <span class="rating">★★★★★</span><br> Such a sweet
comic. A beautiful little story about family, immigration, culture,
language, and queerness. This one checks all my boxes.</p></li>

and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe</a><br>
<span class="rating">★★★★★</span><br> Easily one of my favorite books,
along with the sequel. This was my third time reading it, and it holds
up. I'm excited to discuss this one with my students at the start of
term.</p></li>

Perks of Being a Wallflower</a><br>
<span class="rating">★★★★★</span><br> I haven't read this book since I
was in high school, and I forgot how heavy it is. It doesn't shy away
from the pain of being a lonely adolescent, and it talks frankly about
all the activities that parents often don't want to think about their
kids partaking in. It's a very honest, kind, and empathetic book, and I
think it holds up.</p></li>

the Great Is Not Okay</a><br> <span class="rating">★★★★☆</span><br> It's
cute and it reads fast since it's YA. I loved the discussion of mental
illness, especially among male characters. I also learned a lot about
Iran and Persian culture.</p></li>

Brother's Husband</a><br> <span class="rating">★★★★☆</span><br> I wasn't
expecting to like this manga as much as I did, but I really enjoyed it.
It's very cutesy and wholesome, even though it deals with some heavy
themes.</p></li>
