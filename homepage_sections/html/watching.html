<li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/VS2gv--0Pug?si=SpVxwTOfs3k7NrZv">The
Boyfriend</a><br> <span class="rating">â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†</span><br> Very cute and
wholesome, just as all the reviews I've read promised. I don't usually
watch reality TV, but I wanted to watch this one a) to support queer
media, and b) everyone was saying how sweet it was. I don't know that I
would recommend it, but I will probably watch a second season if they
ever release one in the US.</p></li>

<span class="rating">â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†</span><br> Visually stunning, phenomenal
music. The plot was on the predictable side, but it was still a very fun
movie.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/PuiWDn976Ek?si=_xZkR58sLQuEc8IA">Beau
Is Afraid</a><br> <span class="rating">â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†</span><br> I'm glad I
watched it, but I was honestly disappointed. I like Ari Aster's other
films so much that I guess I had pretty high expectations for this one.
It wasn't very scary, and TBH I was pretty confused about what was going
on most of the time.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/3_jTVuExbAo?si=V43vqUWkeJzI7Yx4">What
We Do in the Shadows</a><br> <span class="rating">â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…</span><br>
Honestly one of the best TV commedies I've ever seen. So consistently
good, and the series finale was very satisfying.</p></li>
