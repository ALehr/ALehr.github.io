<li><p>Sinners<br> <span class="rating">â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†</span><br> Visually
stunning, phenomenal music. The plot was on the predictable side, but it
was still a very fun movie.</p></li>
<li><p>Beau Is Afraid<br> <span class="rating">â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†</span><br> I'm glad
I watched it, but I was honestly disappointed. I like Ari Aster's other
films so much, that I guess I had pretty high expectations for this one.
It wasn't very scary, and TBH I was pretty confused about what was going
on most of the time.</p></li>
<li><p>What We Do in the Shadows<br>
<span class="rating">â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…</span><br> Honestly one of the best TV
commedies I've ever seen. So consistently good, and the series finale
was very satisfying.</p></li>
