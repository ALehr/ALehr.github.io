Boyfriend</a><br> <span class="rating">â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†</span><br> Very cute and
wholesome, just as all the reviews I've read promised. I don't usually
watch reality TV, but I wanted to watch this one a) to support queer
media, and b) everyone was saying how sweet it was. I don't know that I
would recommend it, but I will probably watch a second season if they
ever release one in the US.</p></li>

<span class="rating">â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†</span><br> Visually stunning, phenomenal
music. The plot was on the predictable side, but it was still a very fun
movie.</p></li>
