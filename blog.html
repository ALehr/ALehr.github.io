            <!-- BEGIN converted .md from /markdown/blog/ --><article id="2025-09-20"> <h2>Saturday 20 September 2025</h2> <p>I took the day off from work yesterday to give myself a three-day weekend and some much needed time to recover from the beginning of the school year so far. I'm really glad I did because I desperately needed it. I got so much done on Friday that I've actually been able to enjoy a nice slow Saturday today, and I'll still have time to prep for Monday tomorrow. It would be sooo nice if three-day weekends were the standard, but I don't see that happening any time soon.</p> <p>The only sour point to this weekend is my vaccine fatigue. Given the extended weekend, I decided to get both my flu shot and my COVID booster yesterday. That way I would have all weekend to recover and be back to 100% by Monday. The plan will work, I'm sure, but I am dragging serious ass today. I'm tired and achy, and I've spent most of the afternoon in bed reading and napping. Honestly not a terrible way to spend a Saturday, but I do wish I had more energy to enjoy this bit of time off.</p> </article><button class="previous"><a href="#2025-08-06">2025-08-06</a></button><article id="2025-08-06"> <h2>Wednesday 6 August 2025</h2> <h3 id="85c-café">85°C Café</h3> <p>There’s this bakery that I used to go to all the time back home in San Diego, <a href="https://www.85cbakerycafe.com">85 Degrees</a>. It’s a Taiwanese bakery, so they have all sorts of stuff, both salty and sweet, eastern and western. They recently opened a location in Salt Lake City, and while Daniel and I were there, we went like four times. We even got a cute little tote bag from them!</p> <p><img src="./images/85-degrees-bag.png" alt="red branded tote bag from 85 degrees bakery" /></p> <h3 id="japong-bakery">Japong Bakery</h3> <p>85 Degrees doesn't have any locations on the East Coast, but Daniel found a similar bakery near-ish to us in Rockville, <a href="https://www.japongbakery.com/#5">Japong Bakery</a>. We decided to go yesterday for Daniel’s birthday, and it was so good! Our favorite items were:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.japongbakery.com/?item=119#6">pork sung &amp; scallion swiss roll</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.japongbakery.com/?item=201#6">garlic, ham, &amp; cheese bread</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.japongbakery.com/?item=289#5">marble chocolate bun</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.japongbakery.com/?item=77#10">egg custard tart</a></li> </ul> <p>The ambiance was nice, too. Cozy with lots of cushy seating. We hung out there for a little over an hour, eating, reading, and drinking coffee. Overall it was a really nice outing, and we'll definitely go back.</p> </article><button class="previous"><a href="#2025-08-02">2025-08-02</a></button><button class="next"><a href="#2025-09-20">2025-09-20</a></button><article id="2025-08-02"> <h2>Saturday 2 August 2025</h2> <p>Instead of writing a bunch of little blog posts throughout my time in Salt Lake City, I figured I could just write a summary post once I got back to Maryland.

We made it here safely, but man oh man has it been a rough day. We both got very little sleep last night.</p> <p>Our flight this morning boarded at 7:30, and it takes an hour and 40 minutes to get to the airport from our house. Rather than getting up super early to get to the airport on time, we decided to spend last night at a hotel near the airport. That way we could get up a bit later in the morning and get better sleep. (We wouldn't normally spend money on something like this, but given that we won't be paying for a hotel stay in SLC, we felt that the expense was worth it.)</p> <p>What we failed to take into account was the time it would take to get to the hotel. We decided to take the metro to the airport and then to take the hotel’s free shuttle from the airport to the hotel. This added an extra 30 minutes onto the trip, and then we missed two shuttles (one because we couldn’t find it and the second because it was full). That added another hour onto the trip. We ended up getting to bed around 11 and getting less sleep than we would have if we had just stayed home and gotten up early.</p> <p>The moral of the story: Think through full timelines before you make last-minute changes to your travel plans. 😓</p> </article><button class="previous"><a href="#2025-07-12">2025-07-12</a></button><button class="next"><a href="#2025-08-02">2025-08-02</a></button><article id="2025-07-12"> <h2>Saturday 12 July 2025</h2> <p>So I decided to build a blog. In the year of our Lord 2025, I decided to build an old-school blog.</p> <h3 id="but-like-why-a-blog">But like, why a blog?</h3> <p>Lots of reasons.</p> <p>Last year, a friend of mine started sending quarterly updates on her life to friends and family via a snail-mail quarterly periodical that she designs and prints herself. I love this idea so much and wanted to do something similar, but I prefer to do things digitally. While brainstorming options, I realized that what I really want is just some simple, straightforward way to keep the people in my life up to date on what’s going on with me, my interests, what I’m up to, etc.</p> <p>I briefly flirted with the idea of trying to be more intentional about my use of Instagram to achieve this goal, but:</p> <ul> <li><p>Instagram is simply way too distracting for me (and you too, I bet).</p></li> <li><p>Instagram posts and stories are image-first, which means that:</p> <ul> <li><p>I would need to find an image to headline every update I may want to share, even if I don’t need or want an image. (I.e., you can’t just write a plain-text blog post.)</p></li> <li><p>The image becomes the focus of any given update, and people may not even read the caption (which would contain the update I’m trying to share in the first place).</p></li> </ul></li> <li><p>You can’t customize your Instagram profile much, and I want more room for self-expression (changing colors and fonts, layouts, widgets, etc).</p></li> </ul> <p>I realized that what I really want is something like old-school MySpace. I want a webpage that’s exclusively about me, with no banners and sidebars all over the place that link to other people’s stuff. I want a webpage that I can customize to include whatever I want in whatever configuration I want. I want the nostalgic experience of something retro (like my friend’s periodical).</p> <h3 id="why-did-i-build-it-all-myself">Why did I build it all myself?</h3> <p>I browsed around a bit to see whether there were any websites out there that met my criteria, but nothing really felt right to me. So I decided that if I want <em>exactly what I want</em>, I should make it myself.</p> <p>Notice that at the top of this post I said that I decided to “build” a blog, not “start” a blog. This website that you’re reading this on, I built it all myself. And it’s not just plain HTML and CSS either — I built an entire static site generator that creates the HTML I need from individual text files that hold my blog posts and interests sections.</p> <p>So like, why did I do this?</p> <ul> <li>Because I can.</li> <li>Because I haven’t done much web development since I left my job at the software company, and I miss it.</li> <li>Because I wanted full control over the structure of the components of the website.</li> <li>Because I wanted to challenge myself with a difficult project over the summer.</li> <li>Because I wanted to learn some new skills (which I did!)</li> </ul> <h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3> <p>I’ll be posting whatever I feel like to this website for the foreseeable future. I may advertise updates on Instagram, or I may not. Ultimately, even if no one really reads this blog, I’m going to keep it up because I’m having a lot of fun with it.</p> <p>Eventually I'd also like to turn this little project into something that anyone can use to customize and publish their own blog. More to come on that as I get things worked out.</p> </article><button class="next"><a href="#2025-07-16">2025-07-16</a></button><!-- END converted .md from /markdown/blog/ -->
