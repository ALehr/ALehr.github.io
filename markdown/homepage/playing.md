## 🎮 What I'm Playing

### Currently Playing

- Final Fantasy Tactics Advance (the original on my modded 3DS!)

- Trying out literally SO MANY Game Boy Advance games now that I finally got around to setting up [open_abg_firm](https://github.com/profi200/open_agb_firm) on my 3DS

### Past Games

#### [Hades 2](https://youtu.be/U8lJRcUeEMs?si=FWLVsTxR9OOg2WsF)

<span class="rating">★★★★☆</span>

I have surprisingly little to say about this game. I've enjoyed it a lot, don't get me wrong, but I got tired of it much more quickly than I had expected. I LOVED the first game, and I really enjoyed this sequel, but I just didn't connect with it in the same way. The gameplay is a good iteration on the original, and the story is interesting, but it's just missing something for me. I kept playing the Hades endgame content for a _long_ time after having finished the main story, but I struggled to even stick with Hades 2 for long enough to finish off the two final bosses.

I realize that this review doesn't really reflect the rating I gave the game, but that's just because I'm comparing it to the first game. Hades 2 is a very good game, it just doesn't fully reach the bar set by the first game. I still recommend it, though.
