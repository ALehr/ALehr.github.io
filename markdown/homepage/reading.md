Oof. Dark and upsetting. This book details the strategy that MAGA Republicans followed to destabilize and take over the Republican party. It also shows how a lot of Republicans got radicalized to begin with.<br><br>
Each chapter is told as a character-driven narrative, which really helped me to understand how, within the conservative echo chamber, otherwise rational individuals came to believe / go along with some really crazy stuff. (And it also pulls no punches when it comes to discussing the reality of all the angry, bad-faith bad actors in the party.)

- [Aristotle and Dante Dive into the Waters of the World](https://bookshop.org/p/books/aristotle-and-dante-dive-into-the-waters-of-the-world-benjamin-alire-saenz/18236448?ean=9781534496200&next=t)<br>

I love this book as much as the first volume. This was my third time reading it, and it was just as moving as the first time I read it.<br><br>
As the title implies, this second volume is about Aristotle and Dante figuring out where they fit in the broader world of adults and just how difficult that can be. The book explores racism, classism, and homophobia in a frank but age-appropriate manner. An essential read, in my opinion.<br><br>
The only thing I don't love about this book is how overly earnest all the characters are. It feels a bit artificial and cringy to me, even for a YA book. That said, it's not a major distraction and does not detract from all the things I love about this book.
