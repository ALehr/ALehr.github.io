<span class="rating">★★★★★</span>

I read The Secret History a few years ago, and I remember liking it a lot. Recently, however, I've had some conversations about the book with other Classicists, who are generally pretty divided on it. So I decided to revisit it to see whether my opinion on the book has changed now that I've been teaching Latin and Classical Humanities for four years. Nope — I still really like this book. I find it compelling and well written, and I sped through it just as quickly as the first time I read it.

This second time around, I listened to the audio book, which is narrated by the author. I enjoyed it a lot, which was a surprise since authors are not always the best readers of their own books. There were a few things I didn't like — her pronunciation of Latin, Greek, and French is atrocious, and I found the voice that she puts on for Bunny to be a bit grating — but overall I enjoyed listening to her.
