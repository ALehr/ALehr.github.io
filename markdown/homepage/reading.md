I love this book as much as the first volume. This was my third time reading it, and it was just as moving as the first time I read it.<br><br>
As the title implies, this second volume is about Aristotle and Dante figuring out where they fit in the broader world of adults and just how difficult that can be. The book explores racism, classism, and homophobia in a frank but age-appropriate manner. An essential read, in my opinion.<br><br>
The only thing I don't love about this book is how overly earnest all the characters are. It feels a bit artificial and cringy to me, even for a YA book. That said, it's not a major distraction and does not detract from all the things I love about this book.

- [The Magic Fish](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-magic-fish-trung-le-nguyen/14722854?ean=9781984851598&next=t)<br>

Such a sweet comic. A beautiful little story about family, immigration, culture, language, and queerness. This one checks all my boxes.
