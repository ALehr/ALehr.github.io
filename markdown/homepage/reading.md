<span class="rating">★★★★★</span>

I really loved this book. Stephen King at his finest. Reminded me a bit of [Hearts in Atlantis](https://bookshop.org/p/books/hearts-in-atlantis-stephen-king/2d301d3b2a676b4d?ean=9781501195976&next=t): Starts out as a sweet slice-of-life story about a kid befriending an old man, and then things turn supernatural.

Even though I have my qualms with how King writes women and (doesn't) write queer people, I really enjoy the interactions between his characters. He's good at writing distinct, vivid personalities and realistic relationships between them.

Also, I highly recommend the audio book. I listed to a lot of audio books by necessity, and I'm usually pretty apathetic about the experience. The narrator of this one, however, Seth Numrich, did a fantastic job. I really enjoyed listening to him tell the story and felt very much that his voice and acting were a part of the experience for me.

#### [Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End](https://bookshop.org/p/books/being-mortal-medicine-and-what-matters-in-the-end-atul-gawande/586355?ean=9781250076229&next=t)

<span class="rating">★★★★☆</span>

Super depressing but very interesting. Also important, I think. It's about death and what brings us there. The first half is about old age and the history of elder care, including intergenerational homes, poor houses, nursing homes, and assisted living facilities. The second half is about terminal cancer patients.

The main message of the book is that we're all going to die, but no one wants to think about the realities of death, so we tend to make poor decisions about our health care at the end of our lives. Instead, Gawande urges everyone to think about what they really want in the end and to make medical decisions based on those priorities. He also offers guidance on how to have those conversations, both with others and with ourselves.
