Holy shit what an opening! The introductory sequence lasts almost 45 minutes, but it's phenomenal. Masterful suspense, and it really sets the tone for the film.<br><br>
But also the _decisions_? That people _make_?? In this _MOVIE_??!!! Grade-A horror film idiocy.<br><br>
And Justin Long's character is such an amazing douche bag that I was really craving his torture.<br><br>
My only gripe is that the second half of the film wasn't as scary as the first. Still had fun watching it, though, and I'm excited for Zach Cregger's new movie, [Weapons](https://youtu.be/OpThntO9ixc?si=sAadp9qtwOyOl_eF).

Very cute and wholesome, just as all the reviews I've read promised. I don't usually watch reality TV, but I wanted to watch this one a) to support queer media, and b) everyone was saying how sweet it was. I don't know that I would recommend it, but I will probably watch a second season if they ever release one in the US.
