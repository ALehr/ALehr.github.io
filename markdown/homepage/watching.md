Fully binged it over the course of about a week, so that says something right there. It's fun, and it's touching. It's also packed full of great D&D references that you'll appreciate if you play, but they aren't essential to know what's going on or to enjoy the show.<br><br>
I can't wait for season 2 to come out, and I'll probably read the manga in the meantime.

Holy shit! Such a good horror film! It's very well structured and maintains suspense throughout the runtime. The acting was great, the story was engaging, the minimal visuals were employed very well. Nothing bad to say about this one.
