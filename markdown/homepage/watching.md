I haven't seen the original *Alien* in a long time, so I decided to rewatch it after finishing *Alien: Romulus* (which I really didn't like). It's amazing how well this movie holds up. It's a slow-burn, suspenseful horror movie, and even though I know exactly what to expect in this movie, I still felt that suspense. Watching it the first time through, you don't know what's going to happen to Kane, and that lack of knowledge drives much of the suspense in the first part of the film. However, even knowing what was going to happen, I still felt all the tension and dread that Ridley Scott intended.

10/10, it's a classic for a reason.

Man oh man was this a disappointing and dull film. It was basically just a mishmash of scenes attempting to answer "what if" and "how would you" questions that fans of the *Alien* franchise like to ask each other.

- "How could you get a face-hugger off someone?"
- "What would happen if you got it off before it was done?"
- "How would you deal with the acid blood?"

I'm not saying that attempting to answer those questions in a sequel is inherently a bad thing, but you still need to have something more substantial to build a plot on, something that you're actually adding to the franchise. I didn't see that here. The plot was paper thin, doing nothing more than providing opportunities for fan service.

All that said, I did enjoy many of the set pieces in the film, and there were a handful of very cool shots.
