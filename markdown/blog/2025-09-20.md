I took the day off from work yesterday to give myself a three-day weekend and some much needed time to recover from the beginning of the school year so far. I'm really glad I did because I desperately needed it. I got so much done on Friday that I've actually been able to enjoy a nice slow Saturday today, and I'll still have time to prep for Monday tomorrow. It would be sooo nice if three-day weekends were the standard, but I don't see that happening any time soon.

The only sour point to this weekend is my vaccine fatigue. Given the extended weekend, I decided to get both my flu shot and my COVID booster yesterday. That way I would have all weekend to recover and be back to 100% by Monday. The plan will work, I'm sure, but I am dragging serious ass today. I'm tired and achy, and I've spent most of the afternoon in bed reading and napping. Honestly not a terrible way to spend a Saturday, but I do wish I had more energy to enjoy this bit of time off.
