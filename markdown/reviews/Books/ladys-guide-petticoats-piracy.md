I liked this book _almost_ as much as I did the first one in the series, _The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue_, but something was just a little off for me. It was slower in the beginning, and it just didn't quite hook me the same way. Maybe because it's not a full-on gay YA romp like the first book? Who knows. In any case, I got really into it after about 25% and finished the rest quickly.
