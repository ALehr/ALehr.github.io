I really loved this book. Stephen King at his finest. Reminded me a bit of [Hearts in Atlantis](https://bookshop.org/p/books/hearts-in-atlantis-stephen-king/2d301d3b2a676b4d?ean=9781501195976&next=t): Starts out as a sweet slice-of-life story about a kid befriending an old man, and then things turn supernatural.

Even though I have my qualms with how King writes women and (doesn't) write queer people, I really enjoy the interactions between his characters. He's good at writing distinct, vivid personalities and realistic relationships between them.

Also, I highly recommend the audio book. I listen to a lot of audio books by necessity, and I'm usually pretty apathetic about the experience. The narrator of this one, however, Seth Numrich, did a fantastic job. I really enjoyed listening to him tell the story and felt very much that his voice and acting were a part of the experience for me.
