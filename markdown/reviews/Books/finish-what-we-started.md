Oof. Dark and upsetting. This book details the strategy that MAGA Republicans followed to destabilize and take over the Republican party. It also shows how a lot of Republicans got radicalized to begin with.

Each chapter is told as a character-driven narrative, which really helped me to understand how, within the conservative echo chamber, otherwise rational individuals came to believe / go along with some really crazy stuff. (And it also pulls no punches when it comes to discussing the reality of all the angry, bad-faith bad actors in the party.)
