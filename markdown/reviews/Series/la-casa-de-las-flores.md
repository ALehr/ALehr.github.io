This show is so fucking funny. I binged all three seasons plus the two movies in a matter of weeks. I can't recommend it enough.

Note that the show is in Spanish. If you don't speak Spanish, I still recommend it, and I recommend that you watch it in Spanish with subtitles. The actors are so good, their delivery is so on point, and I would worry that something would be lost in the English dub.
