Fully binged it over the course of about a week, so that says something right there. It's fun, and it's touching. It's also packed full of great D&D references that you'll appreciate if you play, but they aren't essential to know what's going on or to enjoy the show.

I can't wait for season 2 to come out, and I'll probably read the manga in the meantime.
