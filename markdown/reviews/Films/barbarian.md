Holy shit what an opening! The introductory sequence lasts almost 45 minutes, but it's phenomenal. Masterful suspense, and it really sets the tone for the film.

But also the _decisions_? That people _make_?? In this _MOVIE_??!!! Grade-A horror film idiocy.

And Justin Long's character is such an amazing douche bag that I was really craving his torture.

My only gripe is that the second half of the film wasn't as scary as the first. Still had fun watching it, though, and I'm excited for Zach Cregger's new movie, [Weapons](https://youtu.be/OpThntO9ixc?si=sAadp9qtwOyOl_eF).
