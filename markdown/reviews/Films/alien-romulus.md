Man oh man was this a disappointing and dull film. It was basically just a mishmash of scenes attempting to answer "what if" and "how would you" questions that fans of the *Alien* franchise like to ask each other.

- "How could you get a face-hugger off someone?"
- "What would happen if you got it off before it was done?"
- "How would you deal with the acid blood?"

I'm not saying that attempting to answer those questions in a sequel is inherently a bad thing, but you still need to have something more substantial to build a plot on, something that you're actually adding to the franchise. I didn't see that here. The plot was paper thin, doing nothing more than providing opportunities for fan service.

All that said, I did enjoy many of the set pieces in the film, and there were a handful of very cool shots.
