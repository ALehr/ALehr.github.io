I haven't seen the original *Alien* in a long time, so I decided to rewatch it after finishing *Alien: Romulus* (which I really didn't like). It's amazing how well this movie holds up. It's a slow-burn, suspenseful horror movie, and even though I know exactly what to expect in this movie, I still felt that suspense. Watching it the first time through, you don't know what's going to happen to Kane, and that lack of knowledge drives much of the suspense in the first part of the film. However, even knowing what was going to happen, I still felt all the tension and dread that Ridley Scott intended.

10/10, it's a classic for a reason.
