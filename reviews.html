This was my third time reading it, and it holds up. I'm excited to discuss this one with my students at the start of term.</p></div><div id="darius-the-great-is-not-okay"><h3><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/darius-the-great-is-not-okay-adib-khorram/16449090?ean=9780525552970&next=t">Darius the Great Is Not Okay</a></h3> <p class="rating">★★★★☆</p> <p>It's cute and it reads fast since it's YA. I loved the discussion of mental illness, especially among male characters. I also learned a lot about Iran and Persian culture.</p></div><div id="my-brothers-husband"><h3><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/my-brother-s-husband-volumes-1-2-gengoroh-tagame/8520603?ean=9780375715181&next=t">My Brother's Husband</a></h3> <p class="rating">★★★★☆</p> <p>I wasn't expecting to like this manga as much as I did, but I really enjoyed it. It's very cutesy and wholesome, even though it deals with some heavy themes.</p></div><div id="perks-of-being-a-wallflower"><h3><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower-stephen-chbosky/7061668?ean=9780671027346&next=t">The Perks of Being a Wallflower</a></h3> <p class="rating">★★★★★</p> <p>I haven't read this book since I was in high school, and I forgot how heavy it is. It doesn't shy away from the pain of being a lonely adolescent, and it talks frankly about all the activities that parents often don't want to think about their kids partaking in. It's a very honest, kind, and empathetic book, and I think it holds up.</p></div></section><section id="Comics & Graphic Novels"><h2>Comics & Graphic Novels</h2><div id="magic-fish"><h3><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-magic-fish-trung-le-nguyen/14722854?ean=9781984851598&next=t">The Magic Fish</a></h3> <p class="rating">★★★★★</p> <p>Such a sweet comic. A beautiful little story about family, immigration, culture, language, and queerness. This one checks all my boxes.</p></div></section><section id="Films"><h2>Films</h2><div id="beau-is-afraid"><h3><a href="https://youtu.be/PuiWDn976Ek?si=_xZkR58sLQuEc8IA">Beau Is Afraid</a></h3> <p class="rating">★★★☆☆</p> <p>I'm glad I watched it, but I was honestly disappointed. I like Ari Aster's other films so much that I guess I had pretty high expectations for this one. It wasn't very scary, and TBH I was pretty confused about what was going on most of the time.</p></div><div id="sinners"><h3><a href="https://youtu.be/bKGxHflevuk?si=WgTsl_5-Oe1qhzQB">Sinners</a></h3> <p class="rating">★★★★☆</p> <p>Visually stunning, phenomenal music. The plot was on the predictable side, but it was still a very fun movie.</p></div></section><section id="Series"><h2>Series</h2><div id="boyfriend"><h3><a href="https://youtu.be/VS2gv--0Pug?si=SpVxwTOfs3k7NrZv">The Boyfriend</a></h3> <p class="rating">★★★☆☆</p> <p>Very cute and wholesome, just as all the reviews I've read promised. I don't usually watch reality TV, but I wanted to watch this one a) to support queer media, and b) everyone was saying how sweet it was. I don't know that I would recommend it, but I will probably watch a second season if they ever release one in the US.</p></div><div id="what-we-do-in-the-shadows"><h3><a href="https://youtu.be/3_jTVuExbAo?si=V43vqUWkeJzI7Yx4">What We Do in the Shadows</a></h3> <p class="rating">★★★★★</p> <p>Honestly one of the best TV commedies I've ever seen. So consistently good, and the series finale was very satisfying.</p></div></section><!-- END converted .md from /reviews/ -->
