This was my third time reading it, and it holds up. I'm excited to discuss this one with my students at the start of term.</p></div><div id="aristotle-and-dante-dive-into-the-waters-of-the-world"><h3><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/aristotle-and-dante-dive-into-the-waters-of-the-world-benjamin-alire-saenz/18236448?ean=9781534496200&next=t">Aristotle and Dante Dive into the Waters of the World</a></h3> <p class="author">by Benjamin Alire Saenz</p> <p class="rating">★★★★★</p> <p>I love this book as much as the first volume. This was my third time reading it, and it was just as moving as the first time I read it.</p> <p>As the title implies, this second volume is about Aristotle and Dante figuring out where they fit in the broader world of adults and just how difficult that can be. The book explores racism, classism, and homophobia in a frank but age-appropriate manner. An essential read, in my opinion.</p> <p>The only thing I don't love about this book is how overly earnest all the characters are. It feels a bit artificial and cringy to me, even for a YA book. That said, it's not a major distraction and does not detract from all the things I love about this book.</p></div><div id="being-mortal"><h3><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/being-mortal-medicine-and-what-matters-in-the-end-atul-gawande/586355?ean=9781250076229&next=t">Being Mortal&colon; Medicine and What Matters in the End</a></h3> <p class="author">by Atul Gawande</p> <p class="rating">★★★★☆</p> <p>Super depressing but very interesting. Also important, I think. It's about death and what brings us there. The first half is about old age and the history of elder care, including intergenerational homes, poor houses, nursing homes, and assisted living facilities. The second half is about terminal cancer patients.</p> <p>The main message of the book is that we're all going to die, but no one wants to think about the realities of death, so we tend to make poor decisions about our health care at the end of our lives. Instead, Gawande urges everyone to think about what they really want in the end and to make medical decisions based on those priorities. He also offers guidance on how to have those conversations, both with others and with ourselves.</p></div><div id="darius-the-great-is-not-okay"><h3><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/darius-the-great-is-not-okay-adib-khorram/16449090?ean=9780525552970&next=t">Darius the Great Is Not Okay</a></h3> <p class="author">by Adib Khorram</p> <p class="rating">★★★★☆</p> <p>It's cute and it reads fast since it's YA. I loved the discussion of mental illness, especially among male characters. I also learned a lot about Iran and Persian culture.</p></div><div id="finish-what-we-started"><h3><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/finish-what-we-started-the-maga-movement-s-ground-war-to-end-democracy-isaac-arnsdorf/b8883ac56adfcff0?ean=9780316497718&next=t">Finish What We Started&colon; The MAGA Government's Ground War to End Democracy</a></h3> <p class="author">by Isaac Arnsdorf</p> <p class="rating">★★★★☆</p> <p>Oof. Dark and upsetting. This book details the strategy that MAGA Republicans followed to destabilize and take over the Republican party. It also shows how a lot of Republicans got radicalized to begin with.</p> <p>Each chapter is told as a character-driven narrative, which really helped me to understand how, within the conservative echo chamber, otherwise rational individuals came to believe / go along with some really crazy stuff. (And it also pulls no punches when it comes to discussing the reality of all the angry, bad-faith bad actors in the party.)</p></div><div id="perks-of-being-a-wallflower"><h3><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower-stephen-chbosky/7061668?ean=9780671027346&next=t">The Perks of Being a Wallflower</a></h3> <p class="author">by Stephen Chbosky</p> <p class="rating">★★★★★</p> <p>I haven't read this book since I was in high school, and I forgot how heavy it is. It doesn't shy away from the pain of being a lonely adolescent, and it talks frankly about all the activities that parents often don't want to think about their kids partaking in. It's a very honest, kind, and empathetic book, and I think it holds up.</p></div></section><section id="Comics & Graphic Novels"><h2>Comics & Graphic Novels</h2><div id="magic-fish"><h3><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-magic-fish-trung-le-nguyen/14722854?ean=9781984851598&next=t">The Magic Fish</a></h3> <p class="author">by Trung Le Nguyen</p> <p class="rating">★★★★★</p> <p>Such a sweet comic. A beautiful little story about family, immigration, culture, language, and queerness. This one checks all my boxes.</p></div><div id="my-brothers-husband"><h3><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/my-brother-s-husband-volumes-1-2-gengoroh-tagame/8520603?ean=9780375715181&next=t">My Brother's Husband</a></h3> <p class="author">by Gengoroh Tagame</p> <p class="rating">★★★★☆</p> <p>I wasn't expecting to like this manga as much as I did, but I really enjoyed it. It's very cutesy and wholesome, even though it deals with some heavy themes.</p></div></section><section id="Films"><h2>Films</h2><div id="barbarian"><h3><a href="https://youtu.be/Dr89pmKrqkI?si=cUT_BGKeFDGaJIWk">Barbarian</a></h3> <p class="rating">★★★★☆</p> <p>Holy shit what an opening! The introductory sequence lasts almost 45 minutes, but it's phenomenal. Masterful suspense, and it really sets the tone for the film.</p> <p>But also the <em>decisions</em>? That people <em>make</em>?? In this <em>MOVIE</em>??!!! Grade-A horror film idiocy.</p> <p>And Justin Long's character is such an amazing douche bag that I was really craving his torture.</p> <p>My only gripe is that the second half of the film wasn't as scary as the first. Still had fun watching it, though, and I'm excited for Zach Cregger's new movie, <a href="https://youtu.be/OpThntO9ixc?si=sAadp9qtwOyOl_eF">Weapons</a>.</p></div><div id="beau-is-afraid"><h3><a href="https://youtu.be/PuiWDn976Ek?si=_xZkR58sLQuEc8IA">Beau Is Afraid</a></h3> <p class="rating">★★★☆☆</p> <p>I'm glad I watched it, but I was honestly disappointed. I like Ari Aster's other films so much that I guess I had pretty high expectations for this one. It wasn't very scary, and TBH I was pretty confused about what was going on most of the time.</p></div><div id="kpop-demon-hunters"><h3><a href="https://youtu.be/3JTVQTk36R8?si=9ftTmQzTcfiDdrUd">KPop Demon Hunters</a></h3> <p class="rating">★★★★☆</p> <p>It's a silly kids' movie, but it's a lot of fun. Daniel and I have watched it a few times, both on our own and with my niece. He's also been listening to the soundtrack a lot, and I'm not tired of it yet, so that says something right there.</p></div><div id="sinners"><h3><a href="https://youtu.be/bKGxHflevuk?si=WgTsl_5-Oe1qhzQB">Sinners</a></h3> <p class="rating">★★★★☆</p> <p>Visually stunning, phenomenal music. The plot was on the predictable side, but it was still a very fun movie.</p></div><div id="weapons"><h3><a href="https://youtu.be/OpThntO9ixc?si=sAadp9qtwOyOl_eF">Weapons</a></h3> <p class="rating">★★★★★</p> <p>Holy shit! Such a good horror film! It's very well structured and maintains suspense throughout the runtime. The acting was great, the story was engaging, the minimal visuals were employed very well. Nothing bad to say about this one.</p></div></section><section id="Series"><h2>Series</h2><div id="boyfriend"><h3><a href="https://youtu.be/VS2gv--0Pug?si=SpVxwTOfs3k7NrZv">The Boyfriend</a></h3> <p class="rating">★★★☆☆</p> <p>Very cute and wholesome, just as all the reviews I've read promised. I don't usually watch reality TV, but I wanted to watch this one a) to support queer media, and b) everyone was saying how sweet it was. I don't know that I would recommend it, but I will probably watch a second season if they ever release one in the US.</p></div><div id="frieren"><h3><a href="https://youtu.be/01WEqntM1NI?si=KmcVSHq8x4XHZnxe">Frieren</a></h3> <p class="rating">★★★★★</p> <p>Fully binged it over the course of about a week, so that says something right there. It's fun, and it's touching. It's also packed full of great D&amp;D references that you'll appreciate if you play, but they aren't essential to know what's going on or to enjoy the show.</p> <p>I can't wait for season 2 to come out, and I'll probably read the manga in the meantime.</p></div><div id="what-we-do-in-the-shadows"><h3><a href="https://youtu.be/3_jTVuExbAo?si=V43vqUWkeJzI7Yx4">What We Do in the Shadows</a></h3> <p class="rating">★★★★★</p> <p>Honestly one of the best TV commedies I've ever seen. So consistently good, and the series finale was very satisfying.</p></div></section><!-- END converted .md from /markdown/reviews/ -->
