            <article id="2025-07-16"> <h2>Wednesday 16 July 2025</h2> <p>Daniel and I are in Salt Lake City visiting some family. We made it here safely, but man oh man has it been a rough day. We both got very little sleep last night.</p> <p>Our flight this morning boarded at 7:30, and it takes an hour and 40 minutes to get to the airport from our house. Rather than getting up super early to get to the airport on time, we decided to spend last night at a hotel near the airport. That way we could get up a bit later in the morning and get better sleep. (We wouldn't normally spend money on something like this, but given that we won't be paying for a hotel stay in SLC, we felt that the expense was worth it.)</p> <p>What we failed to take into account was the time it would take to get to the hotel. We decided to take the metro to the airport and then to take the hotel’s free shuttle from the airport to the hotel. This added an extra 30 minutes onto the trip, and then we missed two shuttles (one because we couldn’t find it and the second because it was full). That added another hour onto the trip. We ended up getting to bed around 11 and getting less sleep than we would have if we had just stayed home and gotten up early.</p> <p>The moral of the story: Think through full timelines before you make last-minute changes to your travel plans. 😓</p> </article><section><nav class="post-navigation"><a class="next-button" href="./2025-08-02">Saturday 2 August 2025</a><a class="previous-button" href="./2025-07-12">Saturday 12 July 2025</a></nav></section>
