Instead of writing a bunch of little blog posts throughout my time in Salt Lake City, I figured I could just write a summary post once I got back to Maryland. So that’s what this is.

Highlights from the trip:

- revisited two of my favorite restaurants in the city: [Eva’s Bakery](https://www.evasbakeryslc.com) and [Ruth’s Diner](https://ruthsdiner.com)

- found some cool old Italian western comics from the 70s and 80s in [Utah Book & Magazine](https://www.visitsaltlake.com/listing/utah-book-%26-magazine/63825/)

- watching the Pioneer Day fireworks with my niece and younger nephew

- playing [Phase 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_10) before bed most nights

- taking my niece on her first train ride around the city

- getting a bunch of silly Pokémon collectibles with my sister and my older nephew at [The Nerd Store](https://nerdstoreutah.com)
