### 85&deg;C Café

There’s this bakery that I used to go to all the time back home in San Diego, [85 Degrees](https://www.85cbakerycafe.com). It’s a Taiwanese bakery, so they have all sorts of stuff, both salty and sweet, eastern and western. They recently opened a location in Salt Lake City, and while Daniel and I were there, we went like four times. We even got a cute little tote bag from them!

### Japong Bakery

85 Degrees doesn't have any locations on the East Coast, but Daniel found a similar bakery near-ish to us in Rockville, [Japong Bakery](https://www.japongbakery.com/#5). We decided to go yesterday for Daniel’s birthday, and it was so good! Our favorite items were:

- [pork sung & scallion swiss roll](https://www.japongbakery.com/?item=119#6)
- [garlic, ham, & cheese bread](https://www.japongbakery.com/?item=201#6)
- [marble chocolate bun](https://www.japongbakery.com/?item=289#5)
- [egg custard tart](https://www.japongbakery.com/?item=77#10)

The ambiance was nice, too. Cozy with lots of cushy seating. We hung out there for a little over an hour, eating, reading, and drinking coffee. Overall it was a really nice outing, and we'll definitely go back.
