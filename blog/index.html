I'm really glad I did because I desperately needed it. I got so much done on Friday that I've actually been able to enjoy a nice slow Saturday today, and I'll still have time to prep for Monday tomorrow. It would be sooo nice if three-day weekends were the standard, but I don't see that happening any time soon.</p><p><a class="read-more" href="./2025-09-20">...read more</a></p></article><article id="2025-08-06"><h2>Wednesday 6 August 2025</h2> <h3 id="85c-café">85°C Café</h3> <p>There’s this bakery that I used to go to all the time back home in San Diego, <a href="https://www.85cbakerycafe.com">85 Degrees</a>. It’s a Taiwanese bakery, so they have all sorts of stuff, both salty and sweet, eastern and western. They recently opened a location in Salt Lake City, and while Daniel and I were there, we went like four times. We even got a cute little tote bag from them!</p><p><a class="read-more" href="./2025-08-06">...read more</a></p></article><article id="2025-08-02"><h2>Saturday 2 August 2025</h2> <p>Instead of writing a bunch of little blog posts throughout my time in Salt Lake City, I figured I could just write a summary post once I got back to Maryland. So that’s what this is.</p><p><a class="read-more" href="./2025-08-02">...read more</a></p></article><article id="2025-07-16"><h2>Wednesday 16 July 2025</h2> <p>Daniel and I are in Salt Lake City visiting some family.
