<h3>Saturday 2 August 2025</h3>
<p>Instead of writing a bunch of little blog posts throughout my time in
Salt Lake City, I figured I could just write a summary post once I got
back to Maryland. So that’s what this is.</p>
<p>Highlights from the trip:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>revisited two of my favorite restaurants in the city: <a
href="https://www.evasbakeryslc.com">Eva’s Bakery</a> and <a
href="https://ruthsdiner.com">Ruth’s Diner</a></p></li>
<li><p>found some cool old Italian western comics from the 70s and 80s
in <a
href="https://www.visitsaltlake.com/listing/utah-book-%26-magazine/63825/">Utah
Book &amp; Magazine</a></p></li>
<li><p>watching the Pioneer Day fireworks with my niece and younger
nephew</p></li>
<li><p>playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_10">Phase
10</a> before bed most nights</p></li>
<li><p>taking my niece on her first train ride around the city</p></li>
<li><p>getting a bunch of silly Pokémon collectibles with my sister and
my older nephew at <a href="https://nerdstoreutah.com">The Nerd
Store</a></p></li>
</ul>
