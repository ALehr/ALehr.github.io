<h3>Saturday 12 July 2025</h3>
<p>So I decided to build a blog. In the year of our Lord 2025, I decided
to build an old-school blog.</p>
<h4 id="but-like-why-a-blog">But like, why a blog?</h4>
<p>Lots of reasons.</p>
<p>Last year, a friend of mine started sending quarterly updates on her
life to friends and family via a snail-mail quarterly periodical that
she designs and prints herself. I love this idea so much and wanted to
do something similar, but I prefer to do things digitally. While
brainstorming options, I realized that what I really want is just some
simple, straightforward way to keep the people in my life up to date on
what’s going on with me, my interests, what I’m up to, etc.</p>
<p>I briefly flirted with the idea of trying to be more intentional
about my use of Instagram to achieve this goal, but:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Instagram is simply way too distracting for me (and you too, I
bet).</p></li>
<li><p>Instagram posts and stories are image-first, which means
that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I would need to find an image to headline every update I may want
to share, even if I don’t need or want an image. (I.e., you can’t just
write a plain-text blog post.)</p></li>
<li><p>The image becomes the focus of any given update, and people may
not even read the caption (which would contain the update I’m trying to
share in the first place).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You can’t customize your Instagram profile much, and I want more
room for self-expression (changing colors and fonts, layouts, widgets,
etc).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I realized that what I really want is something like old-school
MySpace. I want a webpage that’s exclusively about me, with no banners
and sidebars all over the place that link to other people’s stuff. I
want a webpage that I can customize to include whatever I want in
whatever configuration I want. I want the nostalgic experience of
something retro (like my friend’s periodical).</p>
<h4 id="why-did-i-build-it-all-myself">Why did I build it all
myself?</h4>
<p>I browsed around a bit to see whether there were any websites out
there that met my criteria, but nothing really felt right to me. So I
decided that if I want <em>exactly what I want</em>, I should make it
myself.</p>
<p>Notice that at the top of this post I said that I decided to “build”
a blog, not “start” a blog. This website that you’re reading this on, I
built it all myself. And it’s not just plain HTML and CSS either — I
built an entire static site generator that creates the HTML I need from
individual text files that hold my blog posts and interests
sections.</p>
<p>So like, why did I do this?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because I can.</li>
<li>Because I haven’t done much web development since I left my job at
the software company, and I miss it.</li>
<li>Because I wanted full control over the structure of the components
of the website.</li>
<li>Because I wanted to challenge myself with a difficult project over
the summer.</li>
<li>Because I wanted to learn some new skills (which I did!)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h4>
<p>I’ll be posting whatever I feel like to this website for the
foreseeable future. I may advertise updates on Instagram, or I may not.
Ultimately, even if no one really reads this blog, I’m going to keep it
up because I’m having a lot of fun with it.</p>
<p>Eventually I'd also like to turn this little project into something
that anyone can use to customize and publish their own blog. More to
come on that as I get things worked out.</p>
