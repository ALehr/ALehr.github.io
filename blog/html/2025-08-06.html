<p>There’s this bakery that I used to go to all the time back home in
San Diego, <a href="https://www.85cbakerycafe.com">85 Degrees</a>. It’s
a Taiwanese bakery, so they have all sorts of stuff, both salty and
sweet, eastern and western. They recently opened a location in Salt Lake
City, and while Daniel and I were there, we went like four times. We
even got a cute little tote bag from them!</p>

<p>85 Degrees doesn't have any locations on the East Coast, but Daniel
found a similar bakery near-ish to us in Rockville, <a
href="https://www.japongbakery.com/#5">Japong Bakery</a>. We decided to
go yesterday for Daniel’s birthday, and it was so good! Our favorite
items were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.japongbakery.com/?item=119#6">pork sung &amp;
scallion swiss roll</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.japongbakery.com/?item=201#6">garlic, ham,
&amp; cheese bread</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.japongbakery.com/?item=289#5">marble chocolate
bun</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.japongbakery.com/?item=77#10">egg custard
tart</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The ambiance was nice, too. Cozy with lots of cushy seating. We hung
out there for a little over an hour, eating, reading, and drinking
coffee. Overall it was a really nice outing, and we'll definitely go
back.</p>
