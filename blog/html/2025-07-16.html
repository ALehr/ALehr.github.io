<h2>Wednesday 16 July 2025</h2>
<p>Daniel and I are in Salt Lake City visiting some family. We made it
here safely, but man oh man has it been a rough day. We both got very
little sleep last night.</p>
<p>Our flight this morning boarded at 7:30, and it takes an hour and 40
minutes to get to the airport from our house. Rather than getting up
super early to get to the airport on time, we decided to spend last
night at a hotel near the airport. That way we could get up a bit later
in the morning and get better sleep. (We wouldn't normally spend money
on something like this, but given that we won't be paying for a hotel
stay in SLC, we felt that the expense was worth it.)</p>
<p>What we failed to take into account was the time it would take to get
to the hotel. We decided to take the metro to the airport and then to
take the hotel’s free shuttle from the airport to the hotel. This added
an extra 30 minutes onto the trip, and then we missed two shuttles (one
because we couldn’t find it and the second because it was full). That
added another hour onto the trip. We ended up getting to bed around 11
and getting less sleep than we would have if we had just stayed home and
gotten up early.</p>
<p>The moral of the story: Think through full timelines before you make
last-minute changes to your travel plans. 😓</p>
