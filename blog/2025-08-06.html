            <article id="2025-08-06" class="card"> <h2>Wednesday 6 August 2025</h2> <h3 id="85c-café">85°C Café</h3> <p>There’s this bakery that I used to go to all the time back home in San Diego, <a href="https://www.85cbakerycafe.com">85 Degrees</a>. It’s a Taiwanese bakery, so they have all sorts of stuff, both salty and sweet, eastern and western. They recently opened a location in Salt Lake City, and while Daniel and I were there, we went like four times. We even got a cute little tote bag from them!</p> <p><img src="../images/85-degrees-bag.png" alt="red branded tote bag from 85 degrees bakery" /></p> <h3 id="japong-bakery">Japong Bakery</h3> <p>85 Degrees doesn't have any locations on the East Coast, but Daniel found a similar bakery near-ish to us in Rockville, <a href="https://www.japongbakery.com/#5">Japong Bakery</a>. We decided to go yesterday for Daniel’s birthday, and it was so good! Our favorite items were:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.japongbakery.com/?item=119#6">pork sung &amp; scallion swiss roll</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.japongbakery.com/?item=201#6">garlic, ham, &amp; cheese bread</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.japongbakery.com/?item=289#5">marble chocolate bun</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.japongbakery.com/?item=77#10">egg custard tart</a></li> </ul> <p>The ambiance was nice, too. Cozy with lots of cushy seating. We hung out there for a little over an hour, eating, reading, and drinking coffee. Overall it was a really nice outing, and we'll definitely go back.</p> </article><section><nav class="post-navigation"><a class="next-button card" href="./2025-09-20">Saturday 20 September 2025</a><a class="previous-button card" href="./2025-08-02">Saturday 2 August 2025</a></nav></section>
