			<h2>Being Mortal{{title}}colon; Medicine and What Matters in the End</h2>
			<p class="author">by Atul Gawande</p> <p><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/being-mortal-medicine-and-what-matters-in-the-end-atul-gawande/586355?ean=9781250076229&next=t">buy this book on Bookshop.org</a></p>
			<p class="rating">★★★★☆</p>
			<p>Super depressing but very interesting. Also important, I think. It's about death and what brings us there. The first half is about old age and the history of elder care, including intergenerational homes, poor houses, nursing homes, and assisted living facilities. The second half is about terminal cancer patients.</p> <p>The main message of the book is that we're all going to die, but no one wants to think about the realities of death, so we tend to make poor decisions about our health care at the end of our lives. Instead, Gawande urges everyone to think about what they really want in the end and to make medical decisions based on those priorities. He also offers guidance on how to have those conversations, both with others and with ourselves.</p>
