			<h2>Fairy Tale</h2>
			<p class="author">by Stephen King</p> <p><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/fairy-tale-stephen-king/452797da1cfdb3be?ean=9781668002193&next=t">buy this book on Bookshop.org</a></p>
			<p class="rating">★★★★★</p>
			<p>I really loved this book. Stephen King at his finest. Reminded me a bit of <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/hearts-in-atlantis-stephen-king/2d301d3b2a676b4d?ean=9781501195976&amp;next=t">Hearts in Atlantis</a>: Starts out as a sweet slice-of-life story about a kid befriending an old man, and then things turn supernatural.</p> <p>Even though I have my qualms with how King writes women and (doesn't) write queer people, I really enjoy the interactions between his characters. He's good at writing distinct, vivid personalities and realistic relationships between them.</p> <p>Also, I highly recommend the audio book. I listen to a lot of audio books by necessity, and I'm usually pretty apathetic about the experience. The narrator of this one, however, Seth Numrich, did a fantastic job. I really enjoyed listening to him tell the story and felt very much that his voice and acting were a part of the experience for me.</p>
