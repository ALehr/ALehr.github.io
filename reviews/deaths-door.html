			<p class="rating">★★★★☆</p>
			<p>I finally finished a game in I can't remember how long! I have some mixed feelings about this one, but ultimately I gave it four stars instead of three because it was compelling enough that I binged it.</p> <p>What I liked:</p> <ul> <li>the art</li> <li>the music</li> <li>the story</li> <li>the gameplay mechanics</li> </ul> <p>What I didn't like:</p> <ul> <li><p>The combat system could have offered more variation, both in terms of weapons and abilities and in terms of enemy types and boss mechanics.</p></li> <li><p>The game has elements of a metroidvania in that you need to revisit old areas once you unlock new abilities in order to access new parts of those areas and collectibles. I like this in most games, but in Death's Door I found it tedious because the maps are large and monotonous enough that it's hard to remember where things are located, which made going back through them later in the game tedious.</p></li> </ul>
