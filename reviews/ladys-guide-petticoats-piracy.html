			<h2>The Lady's Guide to Petticoats and Piracy</h2>

			<p class="rating">★★★★☆</p>
			<p>I liked this book <em>almost</em> as much as I did the first one in the series, <em>The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue</em>, but something was just a little off for me. It was slower in the beginning, and it just didn't quite hook me the same way. Maybe because it's not a full-on gay YA romp like the first book? Who knows. In any case, I got really into it after about 25% and finished the rest quickly.</p>
