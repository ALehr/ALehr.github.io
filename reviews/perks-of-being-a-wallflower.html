			<h2>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</h2>
			<p class="author">by Stephen Chbosky</p> <p><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower-stephen-chbosky/7061668?ean=9780671027346&next=t">buy this book on Bookshop.org</a></p>
			<p class="rating">★★★★★</p>
			<p>I haven't read this book since I was in high school, and I forgot how heavy it is. It doesn't shy away from the pain of being a lonely adolescent, and it talks frankly about all the activities that parents often don't want to think about their kids partaking in. It's a very honest, kind, and empathetic book, and I think it holds up.</p>
