Perks of Being a Wallflower</a></h3>
<p>rating 5/5</p>
<p>I haven't read this book since I was in high school, and I forgot how
heavy it is. It doesn't shy away from the pain of being a lonely
adolescent, and it talks frankly about all the activities that parents
often don't want to think about their kids partaking in. It's a very
honest, kind, and empathetic book, and I think it holds up.</p>
