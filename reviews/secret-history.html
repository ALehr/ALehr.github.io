			<h2>The Secret History</h2>
			<p class="author">by Donna Tartt</p> <p><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-secret-history-donna-tartt/de5042f1caf6ae3a?ean=9781400031702&next=t">buy this book on Bookshop.org</a></p>
			<p class="rating">★★★★★</p>
			<p>I read The Secret History a few years ago, and I remember liking it a lot. Recently, however, I've had some conversations about the book with other Classicists, who are generally pretty divided on it. So I decided to revisit it to see whether my opinion on the book has changed now that I've been teaching Latin and Classical Humanities for four years. Nope — I still really like this book. I find it compelling and well written, and I sped through it just as quickly as the first time I read it.</p> <p>This second time around, I listened to the audio book, which is narrated by the author. I enjoyed it a lot, which was a surprise since authors are not always the best readers of their own books. There were a few things I didn't like — her pronunciation of Latin, Greek, and French is atrocious, and I found the voice that she puts on for Bunny to be a bit grating — but overall I enjoyed listening to her.</p>
