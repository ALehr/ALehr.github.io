			<p class="rating">★☆☆☆☆</p>
			<p>Man oh man was this a disappointing and dull film. It was basically just a mishmash of scenes attempting to answer "what if" and "how would you" questions that fans of the <em>Alien</em> franchise like to ask each other.</p> <ul> <li>"How could you get a face-hugger off someone?"</li> <li>"What would happen if you got it off before it was done?"</li> <li>"How would you deal with the acid blood?"</li> </ul> <p>I'm not saying that attempting to answer those questions in a sequel is inherently a bad thing, but you still need to have something more substantial to build a plot on, something that you're actually adding to the franchise. I didn't see that here. The plot was paper thin, doing nothing more than providing opportunities for fan service.</p> <p>All that said, I did enjoy many of the set pieces in the film, and there were a handful of very cool shots.</p>
