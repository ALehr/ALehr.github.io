I haven't read this book since I was in high school, and I forgot how heavy it is. It doesn't shy away from the pain of being a lonely adolescent, and it talks frankly about all the activities that parents often don't want to think about their kids partaking in. It's a very honest, kind, and empathetic book, and I think it holds up.
